/* 1. How many suppliers are there?  Use a query! 
2. What is the sum of all the employee's salaries? 
3. What is the price of the cheapest item that Northwind sells?   
4. What is the average price of items that Northwind sells?   
5. What is the price of the most expensive item that Northwind sells?   
6. What is the supplier ID of each supplier and the number of items they 
supply?  You can answer this query by only looking at the Products table. 
7. What is the category ID of each category and the average price of each item 
in the category?  You can answer this query by only looking at the Products 
table. 
8. For suppliers that provide at least 5 items to Northwind, what is the 
supplier ID of each supplier and the number of items they supply?  You 
can answer this query by only looking at the Products table. 
9. List the product id, product name, and inventory value (calculated by 
multiplying unit price by the number of units on hand).  Sort the results in 
descending order by value.  If two or more have the same value, order by 
product name. */
